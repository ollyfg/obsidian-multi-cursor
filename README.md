## Enhanced Multi Cursor

This plugin expands on Obsidian's default multi-cursor support.

- **De-Select** When you Alt-Click on an existing selection, remove it. For those times when you accidentally put a cursor in the middle of a word.
- **Keybindings** Control multiple cursors with your keyboard! Currently supports basic Sublime Text keybindings, PRs welcome!
